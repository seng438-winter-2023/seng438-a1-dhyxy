# Introduction

For this lab, we conducted exploratory and manual testing on the ATM system java program provided for the lab. Originally, we didn't have much formal knowledge on exploratory and manual testing- other than typical manual testing conducted after developing some software.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

We will be doing breadth-focused testing for the specifications of the system, meaning that we will explore most to all functions a little bit in order to achieve maximum coverage.

## Plan
1. Validate that all required UI elements are presented on GUI
    - stripe reader
    - customer console
    - envelope deposit
    - cash dispenser
    - printer
    - on/off switch
2. Customer can log in and out of the system.
3. Customer can make a transaction.
    1. Withdraw
    2. Deposit
    3. Transfer of money
    4. Balance Inquiry
4. Customer can make multiple transactions (listed in 3).
5. Customer can successfully abort transaction in progress.
6. Card is permanently retained after 3 incorrect pin tries.
7. System displays problem explanation for failed transaction.
8. ATM provides receipts for each successful transaction.
9. ATM will verify total cash on hand when turned on, and can only be turned off when not servicing customer.
# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing
Exploratory testing was interesting because it enabled us to simultaneously learn about the system while we tested it. Exploratory testing allowed us to wander off and create our own path rather than being restricted to the documented usecases. While we were able to gather more bugs through the manual functional testing, exploratory opened up opportunities to determine bugs that otherwise could not have been found.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 
The team was split into two groups of two, group 1 (CarolineBasta & Fanny Lo) tested test cases 1-20 and group 2 (Sukriti Sharma &Dhyey Lalseta) tested test cases 21-40. Each group alternated between beingthe tester and the bug analyzer/reporter, ensuring that each member had around10 test cases to do as a tester and 10 test cases as a reporter. This way weensured that all team members had proper exposure to testing techniques and gained experience in both aspects of testing. The team initiallyestablished goals and deadlines for when we wanted our parts of the testingdone, in order to leave sufficient time for peer feedback. Once the groups wereformed, member 1 would go through a test case and replicates it. If a bug isfound, member 2 would log the bug in Jira and ensures all fields were filledwith the proper information. After around 10 test cases, members 1 and 2 switchroles. The team also made sure that every member contributed equally to testingto ensure even distribution of workload and to allow a chance for every teammember to voice their opinion and concerns.
