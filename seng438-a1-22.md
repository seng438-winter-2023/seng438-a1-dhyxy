# Introduction

For this lab, we conducted exploratory and manual testing on the ATM system java program provided for the lab. Originally, we didn't have much formal knowledge on exploratory and manual testing- other than typical manual testing conducted after developing some software.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

We will be doing breadth-focused testing for the specifications of the system, meaning that we will explore most to all functions a little bit in order to achieve maximum coverage.

## Plan
1. Validate that all required UI elements are presented on GUI
    - stripe reader
    - customer console
    - envelope deposit
    - cash dispenser
    - printer
    - on/off switch
2. Customer can log in and out of the system.
3. Customer can make a transaction.
    1. Withdraw
    2. Deposit
    3. Transfer of money
    4. Balance Inquiry
4. Customer can make multiple transactions (listed in 3).
5. Customer can successfully abort transaction in progress.
6. Card is permanently retained after 3 incorrect pin tries.
7. System displays problem explanation for failed transaction.
8. ATM provides receipts for each successful transaction.
9. ATM will verify total cash on hand when turned on, and can only be turned off when not servicing customer.
# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing
Exploratory testing was interesting because it enabled us to simultaneously learn about the system while we tested it. Exploratory testing allowed us to wander off and create our own path rather than being restricted to the documented usecases. While we were able to gather more bugs through the manual functional testing, exploratory opened up opportunities to determine bugs that otherwise could not have been found. 

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

For this assignment, we used Jira as our issue-tracking system of choice. Each bug identified during the exploratory and scripted testing phase is tracked and reported to Jira. During regression testing, each reported bug is re-examined on version 1.1 of the program to verify if it's been corrected. The four group members are divided into pairs, and every member is responsible for reviewing and analyzing the bugs reported by their partner. This is an effective method to ensure the validity of the bug by ensuring that it is reproducible without running into the inefficiencies of multiple members re-examining the same defect.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

The team was split into two groups of two, group 1 (Caroline Basta & Fanny Lo) tested test cases 1-20 and group 2 (Sukriti Sharma & Dhyey Lalseta) tested test cases 21-40. Each group has alternated between being the tester and the bug analyzer/reporter, ensuring that each member had around 10 test cases to do as a tester and 10 test cases as a reporter. This way we ensured that all team members had proper exposure to testing techniques and have gained experience in both aspects of testing. The team has initially established goals and deadlines to when we wanted our parts of the testing done, in order to leave sufficient time for peer feedback. Once the groups were formed, member 1 would go through a test case and replicates it. If a bug is found, member 2 would log the bug in Jira and ensures all fields were filled with the proper information. After around 10 test cases, members 1 and 2 switch roles. The team also made sure that every member contributed equally to testing to ensure even distribution of workload and to allow a chance for every team member to voice their opinion and concerns.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

 Some of the difficulties in this lab were encountered in the initial setup. One of them was creating a bug reporting template to ensure all team members were inputting the same level of detail in the bugs they found, whilst adhering to the lab requirements. This challenge was overcome with a group discussion, where we discussed the essential components of reporting a bug and were able to effectively implement that into our template. Another challenge was avoiding duplicate entries of the same bug. By creating a testing plan and splitting up the test cases, we were able to be proactive against this issue, establishing a more efficient workflow. 

The lessons learned in this lab is that communication and organization are key. Without effective communication, there would be overlap in work, duplicate entries, resulting in a waste of time and effort. Staying organized is essential to fulfilling the requirements and the tasks at the hand. Taking the time to learn how the system is supposed to operate is also crucial in understanding what is a bug in the application.
